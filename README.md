The Bibi is a self-invented species of Tuxedo cat. The Bibi on the top is Hei Bibi named after her asymetrical black nose. The Bibi on her bed is Bai Bibi named after her 
asymetrical predominantly white nose. Both of their names are derrived from the romanization of Chinese, phonetically butchered in English into "Hey Baby" and "Bye Baby."
